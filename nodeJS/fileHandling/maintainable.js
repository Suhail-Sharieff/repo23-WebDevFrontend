import fs from "fs/promises"
/**In the code you provided, await is used to handle asynchronous operations in an async function. If you're using the fs/promises API, which provides promise-based versions of file system operations, you must ensure that await is used within an async function to handle these operations correctly.

Here's a breakdown of why and how to use await in this context:

Explanation
Promise-Based API: fs/promises provides promise-based methods (such as fs.readFile) that allow you to use async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations.

await Keyword: The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an async function until the promise returned by fs.readFile resolves. This makes the asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, which can be easier to read and manage.

async Function Requirement: To use await, you must be inside an async function. If you attempt to use await outside of an async function, you'll get a syntax error. */

let data =await fs.readFile("text.txt")

console.log(data.toString());
